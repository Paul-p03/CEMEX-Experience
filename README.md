# CEMEX-Experience
Hello everyone,

Iâ€™m pleased to share my Final Internship Presentation PowerPoint, summarizing the skills and achievements I gained during my internship as an Automation Engineer at CEMEX in the summer of 2024.

Internship Highlights
Throughout my internship, I utilized SCADA systems to monitor and control industrial equipment, significantly improving real-time feedback efficiency and operational reliability.

One challenging project consisted of assembling and programming Electronic Overload Relays (E300). This involved the customizing of each device to meet its specific operational requirements using RSNetWorx. This project included building a largescale network of devices. Another task required a Virtual Machine for remote desktop access of softwares that allowed development through PI ProcessBook. I created web pages that linked the opstation specific tags to the PI software, with the purpose of removing editor rights and provided corporate level access to real-time operational data.
I operated the ECS OpStation to track and allocate equipment tag status, linking the tags over to softwares such as PiProcessBook and Baileys System. Our goal was to ensure a to enable real-time monitoring and control.
